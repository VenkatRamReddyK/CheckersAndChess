# CheckersAndChess
This Repository contains the list of Games developed in C++:

1. Chinese-Checkers 
2. Indian Checkers and 
3. Chess Game

#Highlights: 
- Date and Time Statistics: August/2008 - Feb/2009 (Almost 6 Months)
- Year of Study           : 2nd Year of My Bachelors
- Development Environment : C++
- Purpose                 : 
    1. Understanding OOPS Principles in a Pragmatic Approach. 
    2. Use SDLC to plan and track the project progress

#Details:
- I was Motivated from one of my Friend "Srikanth", who developed few games in C Language. 
- My professor "Vani Vatsala" appluaded him for his work and progress. 
- That appluade motivated me and initiated to do some thing different that makes people to see me different.  
- After a long Brainstorming for couple of weeks, I had the ambition of developing Chess-game
- I feared chess has many rules and I am novice programmer.
- Then I got the idea of "start-slow dream-big".
- Intitated to develop Checkers which took a long 6 months, the time I spend besides college.
- Further developed Chess Game, which was my Ambition.

#Features: 

#Checkers: 
1. User moves can go 1 step diagonally
2. User moves can jump if there is an obstruction in a diagonal
3. User moves can make multiple jumps with a repetition of step 2.
4. Stalemate, Win are implemented
5. Help Menu
    - User can customize their names and coins 
    - User can choose Game with 8 coins or 12 coins 
    - User can choose a different variant of Checkers Game, chinese checkers where the intial coins layout is at the corners
    - Display Rules of Games
    - "SARIGAMA PADANISA", a famous musical tune in India is added. It is played when users select to display the rules of game 

#Chess Game:
1. All coin moves which include (Pawn , Knight, Bishop, Rook, King, Queen) have been implemented. Boundary-value evaluation for is done for all moves.
2. figuring out threat moves
3. Stalemate, Checkmate, Win, Check are added. 

#Achievements:
1. I had many sleepless nights, but nothing could stop me for my success on Feb/18/2009, on which I was awarded Merit Certificate for My project entitled "Checkers-Game with a design " work at Ciencia'09 Symposium, an Annual Technical Fest conducted by our University. 
2. Enhance the Game by developing Chess-Game, by using Run-time Polymorphism, a concept in OOPS with in a time period of 3 days. I gave more importance to the control flow diagrams and refactoring and class structures than the amount of time I spent on coding, and without which I could not have developed Chess game in 3 days. 
3. Intiated Pair-Programming with the help of Sri kanth, (In Collaborators list)
4. User can select the Game of choice from Help menu and play the game he likes.
5. In total we wrote 6000 lines of code in C++ which is very reliable, where OOPS concepts like pure virtual functions, overriding, abstract classes, abstract methods, final keywords, inheritance, polymorphism, pointers,.. were used
6. Since this game teaches Chess Game, with the basic explanation, my mother is the first customer who used my game to learn chess. What more I can give to her besides the satisfaction she got after learning the chess, developed with my code. 

#Enhancements that could have added:
1. Usage of Design Pattern, that better maintains the class structuring, which I used later in my Masters for Tic-Tac-Toe game using AI.
2. Better naming conventions for variables and methods
3. Better code refactoring, that makes optimal Cohersion and Coupling factor.
4. For checkers, reduce the time complexity and control flow using memorization technique in dynamic programming, which I did later in my masters for Jumper Game.
5. Better User Interface (GUI) would have attracted more customers, which has been overcome in 3rd year of my Bachelors, where I developed "Chess Game" in Java using Swings with a portable GUI, which has mouse events.
6. Feature like life moves, "pawn-promotion with user choice of selecting which promotion should happen" are not handled here, which are handled in "Easy Chess", currently in Windows Market Place 
7. Few corner cases for Check and checkmate are not handled, which are handled in "Easy Chess", currently in Windows Market Place. Windows Phone Market Place Link: http://bit.ly/1Pjjyee
